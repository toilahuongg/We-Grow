This project was created with [Better-T-Stack](https://github.com/AmanVarshney01/create-better-t-stack), a modern TypeScript stack that combines Next.js, Self, ORPC, and more.

## Features

- **TypeScript** - For type safety and improved developer experience
- **Next.js** - Full-stack React framework
- **TailwindCSS** - Utility-first CSS for rapid UI development
- **shadcn/ui** - Reusable UI components
- **oRPC** - End-to-end type-safe APIs with OpenAPI integration
- **Mongoose** - TypeScript-first ORM
- **MongoDB** - Database engine
- **Authentication** - Better-Auth
- **PWA** - Progressive Web App support
- **Turborepo** - Optimized monorepo build system

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

## Database Setup

This project uses MongoDB with Mongoose.

1. Make sure you have MongoDB set up.
2. Update your `apps/web/.env` file with your MongoDB connection URI.

Then, run the development server:

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) in your browser to see the fullstack application.
